In any context with many distributed contributors, not every viewpoint is unanimous; in all organizations - whether gubernatorial, cultural, or otherwise, consensus protocols are established to resolve differing approaches into a unified, cohesive mission. In Bloom's case, this is a key facet for a creative entity determined to foster a novel and healthier ecosystem involving labor contributors, financial contributors, players, art experiencers, collaborative projects, and more. Accordingly, we now seek to formalize Bloom's core governance protocol, to be formally facilitated on chain.",
            "background": "**Definitions**\nSnapshot - A service to facilitate off-chain governance which uses on-chain tokens for quorum and votes\n\n**Background**\nSince development began on Bloom in 2022, there has been an active effort to collectively decide things, which was formalized with per-member voting in a Discord server to date. There have been 35 general proposals and 26 budgetary proposals in this time, refining and establishing a generally satiating, agreeable system that can now be further canonized by moving consensus to Snapshot.\n\nFurther considerations will be necessary and embarked upon when we again transition from soul-bound Arbitrum tokens to a liquid ERC-20, likely named $hue.\n\n---\n\nAs a starting point, Bloom governance will be guided by cascaded governance proposals, with the base, autological proposal being this one. For the time being, proposals will be branched into two main categories, which can be branched further, but will not have distinct proposal syntax and iteration. That is to say, each proposal # is subsequent to the prior within its own primary branch. The two proposal types are:\n\nBloom General Proposals (BGP)\nBloom Budgetary Proposals (BBP)\n\nTo distinguish these two, it is actually easier to define BBPs first. Budgetary Proposals will entail financial structuring, imbursements, bounties, hiring, termination, and so forth. If it affects Bloom's treasury (treasury.bloomstudio.eth), assets collectively held by the studio, or how we organize around these assets, a BBP is in order. Everything else falls under BGPs, such as this proposal.\n\nAn initial quorum of 25% for all Snapshot votes will be necessary for a vote to be considered valid. This quorum will be based on emitted quantity at time of vote. A winning choice must also receive 2/3 (~67%) of participating vote.\n\nInitial contributor tokens eligible for voting:\nangelXP (Arbitrum address: 0x206d247f61cb82b9711318381cdb7bc5039d2a2c)\nbountyXP (Arbitrum address: 0x4cd06ada7d8564830018000d784c69bd542b1e6a)\nunitXP (Arbitrum address: 0x57d3a929fdc4faf1b35e7092d9dee7af097afb6a)",
            "additional": "Vote options could be in one of three formats:\n\nTrinary (select one)\n```\nAdopt\nReassess\nAbstain\n```\n\nRanked Choice (rank)\n```\nA\nB\nC\n```\n\nWeighted Choice (% each)\n```\nA\nB\nC\n```\n---\n\nA structure for each Proposal will be followed in this vote, and assigned as a standard for both inaugural proposal types. It is likely BBP #0 will be formalizing appendages unique to budgetary concerns, but this will have to occur subsequent to BGP #0 passing. The initial structure will adhere to the following format, with some fields optional:\n```\n{Proposal Type} #{Proposal #}: {Proposal Title}\nAuthors {}\nAbstract {}\nDefinitions {} (Optional)\nBackground {} (Optional)\nImplementation Protocol {} (Optional)\nVoting Choices {}\n```\n\n**Implementation Protocol**\nCanonize the aforementioned vote structure for all future proposals.\nAll future proposals will fall under BGP or BBP umbrellas (unless another BGP establishes a third branch of voting types).\n\n**Voting Options**\nAdopt\nReassess\nAbstain"
