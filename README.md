# BloomDiscordBot

# Onboarding Bloomers in the Bloom Studio Server

When a bloomer first joins Bloom Studio's Discord server, they will be welcomed, and encouraged to read and accept the servers rules before they can post. This is a built in anti-spam protection that Discord offers.

After agreeing to the server rules, the bloomer will be able to verify they posses some form of Contributor XP, which upon signing a message through CollabLand will automatically assign the appropriate role to the bloomer

The initial greeting message advise the bloomer where the can get more information about Bloom Studio.

# Quick start guide:

1. Ensure there are existing channels in Bloom Collective, and Bloom Studio Discord servers with the channel names set in constants.py. The bot will determine the required channel IDs / Forum Channel IDs from the channel names in it's respective server.

2. Create a .env file. Reference .env.example for what is required. 

3. Set the proposal parameters and space settings to be used in ./snapshot/snapshot.js. For example:

```
    const proposalParams = {
      space: 'bloomtest.eth', // Set the space
      type: 'weighted', // Define the voting system
      title: removeMarkdown(title),
      body: `Abstract:\n ${removeMarkdown(abstract)}\n\n Background:\n ${removeMarkdown(background)}`,
      choices: choices.map(removeMarkdown),
      start: currentTime,
      end: currentTime + fortyeighthoursinSeconds,
      snapshot: await provider.getBlockNumber(), 
      network: '1',
      plugins: JSON.stringify({}),
      app: 'Gov-test' // provide the name of your project using this Snapshot.js integration
    };
```

__Note__ 

The bot is currently designed to work between both of Blooms servers.
Further support for additional servers, and merging of other bot functionality are in progress.
